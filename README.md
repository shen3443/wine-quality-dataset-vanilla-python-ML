# wine-quality-dataset-vanilla-python-ML
A feedforward neural network to predict wine quality based on a number of scientific factors. 

**NOTE:** This is purely an educational project. This is neither an efficient nor realistic neural network for practical use.

When trying to learn about Neural Networks, I found a common theme where articles would articulate concepts well, but the code would be very difficult to follow because a significant number of complex steps would be executed with one very simple command on one line of code using powerful ML libraries like tensorflow or keras. While these libraries are very important for practical applications of ML, I wanted to build a neural network in vanilla python with (*hopefully*) easy-to-follow code for ML beginners. Undertaking this project helped me learn a lot about the fundamentals of feedforward Neural Networks.
